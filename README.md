Android Vision API Samples
==========================

The Mobile Vision API is now a part of [ML Kit][3]. We strongly encourage you to try it out, as it comes with new capabilities like on-device image labeling! Also, note that we ultimately plan to wind down the Mobile Vision API, with all new on-device ML capabilities released via ML Kit. Check out [this codelab][4] to use the vision APIs in ML Kit.
